## 🔄 Project Flow

Here's how the **Tuljha Hotel** project flows from user interaction to backend processing:

1. **Organization Management**: 
   - Organizations can be added, viewed, and edited from the organization management page.
   - Each organization can be associated with multiple food orders.

2. **Food Orders**: 
   - Hotel managers can create new food orders for an organization by specifying the number of people and the total cost.
   - Each food order is linked to a specific organization and recorded in the database.

3. **Expense Management**: 
   - Daily expenses, such as food purchases or utilities, can be recorded.
   - These expenses will factor into the net profit calculation.

4. **Invoice Generation**:
   - At the end of each month, invoices are generated for each organization.
   - The invoice includes all food orders for that organization and the total cost for the month.

5. **Email Notification**:
   - Invoices are sent to organizations via email at the end of each month, ensuring smooth billing.

6. **Dashboard**:
   - A daily summary of total earnings, expenses, and net profits.
   - Visual analytics using charts to display revenue, expenses, and profit trends.

    contact_person = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15)
```

### 2. **FoodOrder**
Tracks the food orders made by each organization.
```python
class FoodOrder(models.Model):
    organization = models.ForeignKey(Organization, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    number_of_people = models.IntegerField()
    food_items = models.TextField()
    total_cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### 3. **Expense**
Tracks expenses incurred by the hotel.
```python
class Expense(models.Model):
    category = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    date = models.DateField()
    description = models.TextField()
```

### 4. **Invoice**
Generates and tracks invoices for organizations.
```python
class Invoice(models.Model):
    organization = models.ForeignKey(Organization, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    month = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    date_created = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
```
